### **Problem Statement**

Create a tool using React which allows you to easily create a Gantt chart. The tool should save the user's context in cache for repeat visits, and allow the user to print the Gantt chart or save it as a PDF.

### **Technologies Used**

React, MaterialUI

### **Challenges Faced**

The main challenge for this project was the relative inexperience of the team, this being our first major project completed in our computer science degree. Thankfully I had just completed my first internship as a SWE intern, and we chose to leverage the same tech stack which I learned there. This provided a reinforcement of those skills and an opportunity to start fresh.

### **Lessons Learned**

Git/Github, Project Planning/Documentation, Code Quality, Deployment to Github Pages
